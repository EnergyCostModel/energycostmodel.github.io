Dr. Pawel Kaplanski is at the forefront of a new industrial revolution—where machines don’t just move, they think and protect. With a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and formal training in theoretical physics, Dr. Kaplanski brings a unique perspective to the intersection of energy, computation, and human rights.

In the first industrial revolution, humanity learned to convert fuel into motion and built the modern world. Today, Dr. Kaplanski believes we are witnessing an even bigger leap: using energy to create intelligence with AI, and harnessing that energy to secure freedom and trust through Bitcoin.

Having launched and scaled startups in AI, cybersecurity, logistics, and payment systems, and authoring over 45 scientific papers and 2 patents, Dr. Kaplanski’s work explores how the physical laws of energy are reshaping what it means to think, transact, and trust in the digital era.

## Education

### Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science
- **Institution**: Gdańsk University of Technology, Faculty of Informatics and Telecommunication
- **Location**: Gdańsk, Poland
- **Dates**: 06/02/2009 - 23/04/2013
- **Thesis Title**: "Ontology-Aided Software Engineering"
- **Thesis Overview**: Explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Software Engineering to address challenges in software development methodologies. The thesis proposes the use of Description Logic as a formalization of software engineering methods and tools, bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical software development through the novel approach of Ontology-Aided Software Engineering (OASE). This approach leverages Controlled Natural Language for clearer, machine-processable communication within software development, aiming to improve quality, manage knowledge, and enhance the software production process.

### Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science
- **Institution**: Wrocław University of Technology, Faculty of Computer Nets and Systems
- **Location**: Wrocław, Poland
- **Dates**: 01/10/1996 - 17/10/2001
- **Details**: Focused on computer networks and systems, emphasizing the design and optimization of network infrastructures and robust system security measures.
